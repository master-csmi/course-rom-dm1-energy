	abstract = {Digital Twin ({DT}) technology has gained significant attention in various areas, including nuclear energy. Technologies such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, and high-fidelity modeling and simulation have been studied to further the digitalization of the nuclear industry. In this paper, an overview of the {DT} initiatives and developments for the design optimization and intelligent transformation of nuclear energy systems is described to provide a development trend of {DT} technology for nuclear reactors. For the design of {DT} for complex systems such as nuclear reactors, Model Based Systems Engineering ({MBSE}) technology offers requirements models, design processes, and system verification that are clearer, more precise, and more comprehensive. Four properties of Digital Twin for Nuclear Reactor System ({DTNRS}) are summarized, which are given by the block definition diagram of {MBSE} philosophy. Then, to bridge the gap between numerical models and theoretical research of {DT}, a systematic and hierarchical “V” architecture is proposed, which reflects the digital-related technologies of the {DTNRS} throughout the whole life cycle. Furthermore, a four-layered decomposition construction model is developed and a prospective application scenario of {DTNRS} is pictured. Finally, the five-step instructive demonstration of the {DTNRS} is given based on a Generation {III} ({GEN}-{III}) reactor with its visualized condition map.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to provide a comprehensive presentation and interpretation of the Ensemble Kalman Filter ({EnKF}) and its numerical implementation. The {EnKF} has a large user group, and numerous publications have discussed applications and theoretical aspects of it. This paper reviews the important results from these studies and also presents new ideas and alternative interpretations which further explain the success of the {EnKF}. In addition to providing the theoretical framework needed for using the {EnKF}, there is also a focus on the algorithmic formulation and optimal numerical implementation. A program listing is given for some of the key subroutines. The paper also touches upon specific issues such as the use of nonlinear measurements, in situ profiles of temperature and salinity, and data which are available with high frequency in time. An ensemble based optimal interpolation ({EnOI}) scheme is presented as a cost-effective approach which may serve as an alternative to the {EnKF} in some applications. A fairly extensive discussion is devoted to the use of time correlated model errors and the estimation of model bias.},

	abstract = {Based on the conservation laws of mass, energy and momentum, a lumped-parameter dynamical model is proposed for the nuclear heating reactor cogeneration plant {NHR}200-{II} that can be served for electricity production and district heating. This model is mainly composed of the dynamics of the reactor, steam generator, turbine, deaerator, heat exchangers and secondary steam flow network. Then, the steady and transient validation of this lumped-parameter model are given based on the comparison between the parameter values given by this model and the model for plant design, which shows that both the steady and transient errors are acceptable, and which further reveals that the thermal resistances and capacities of this model are properly given. Finally, the open-loop responses under different exterior disturbances such as reactivity and coolant flowrates as well as the closed-loop responses under the cases of power ramp and switch are all given by the numerical simulation software developed based upon this newly-built lumped-parameter model for {NHR}200-{II} plant, where the rationality of the responses are analyzed from the viewpoint of plant physics and thermal-hydraulics. This model can be utilized for not only the control system design but also the development of a real-time simulator for the hardware-in-loop verification of control systems.},

	abstract = {Digital Twins ({DTs}) are receiving considerable attention from multiple disciplines. Much of the literature at this time is dedicated to the conceptualization of digital twins, and associated enabling technologies and challenges. In this paper, we consider these propositions for the specific application of nuclear power. Our review finds that the current {DT} concepts are amenable to nuclear power systems, but benefit from some modifications and enhancements. Further, some areas of the existing modeling and simulation infrastructure around nuclear power systems are adaptable to {DT} development, while more recent efforts in advanced modeling and simulation are less suitable at this time. For nuclear power applications, {DT} development should rely first on mechanistic model-based methods to leverage the extensive experience and understanding of these systems. Model-free techniques can then be adopted to selectively, and correctively, augment limitations in the model-based approaches. Challenges to the realization of a {DT} are also discussed, with some being unique to nuclear engineering, however most are broader. A challenging aspect we discuss in detail for {DTs} is the incorporation of uncertainty quantification ({UQ}). Forward {UQ} enables the propagation of uncertainty from the digital representations to predict behavior of the physical asset. Similarly, inverse {UQ} allows for the incorporation of data from new measurements obtained from the physical asset back into the {DT}. Optimization under uncertainty facilitates decision support through the formal methods of optimal experimental design and design optimization that maximize information gain, or performance, of the physical asset in an uncertain environment.},
